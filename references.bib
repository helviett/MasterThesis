For many applications, the apparent ideal procedure is to represent lines and boundaries by means of polygons with minimum number of vertices and satisfying a given fit criterion. In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small—but not minimum—number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion. The results obtained justify the abandonment of the minimum-vertices criterion which is computationally much more expensive.}

Only the coordinates of white-to-black and black-to-white transition points on each scan line are used as data for the contour tracing. The resulting description of the contour is the combined set of ten newly developed run-type direction codes. The code is determined automatically by an automaton while the horizontal coordinates of two transition points in the two adjacent scan lines are compared. The processing speed of this algorithm depends on the number of transition points of an image, and, thus, it has the advantage over conventional algorithms, where the speed usually depends on the number of pixels. A high-definition-type contour description is obtained and complete restoration of the original image is possible.",

    abstract      = {The number of publications in the area of Cutting and Packing (C&P) has increased considerably over the last two decades. The typology of C&P problems introduced by Dyckhoff [Dyckhoff, H., 1990. A typology of cutting and packing problems. European Journal of Operational Research 44, 145–159] initially provided an excellent instrument for the organisation and categorisation of existing and new literature. However, over the years also some deficiencies of this typology became evident, which created problems in dealing with recent developments and prevented it from being accepted more generally. In this paper, the authors present an improved typology, which is partially based on Dyckhoff’s original ideas, but introduces new categorisation criteria, which define problem categories different from those of Dyckhoff. Furthermore, a new, consistent system of names is suggested for these problem categories. Finally, the practicability of the new scheme is demonstrated by using it as a basis for a categorisation of the C&P literature from the years between 1995 and 2004.}
