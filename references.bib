For many applications, the apparent ideal procedure is to represent lines and boundaries by means of polygons with minimum number of vertices and satisfying a given fit criterion. In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small—but not minimum—number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion. The results obtained justify the abandonment of the minimum-vertices criterion which is computationally much more expensive.}

Only the coordinates of white-to-black and black-to-white transition points on each scan line are used as data for the contour tracing. The resulting description of the contour is the combined set of ten newly developed run-type direction codes. The code is determined automatically by an automaton while the horizontal coordinates of two transition points in the two adjacent scan lines are compared. The processing speed of this algorithm depends on the number of transition points of an image, and, thus, it has the advantage over conventional algorithms, where the speed usually depends on the number of pixels. A high-definition-type contour description is obtained and complete restoration of the original image is possible.",

The algorithm works with almost any kind of input polygons: concave polygons, polygons with holes, several contours and self-intersecting edges. Important topological information, as the holes of the result polygon, is computed.}
