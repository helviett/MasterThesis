    abstract     = {The approximation of arbitrary two-dimensional curves by polygons is an importanttechnique in image processing. For many applications, the apparent ideal procedure is to represent lines and boundaries by means of polygons with minimum number of vertices and satisfying a given fit criterion. In this paper, an approximation algorithm is presented which uses an iterative method to produce polygons with a small—but not minimum—number of vertices that lie on the given curve. The maximum distance of the curve from the approximating polygon is chosen as the fit criterion. The results obtained justify the abandonment of the minimum-vertices criterion which is computationally much more expensive.}

We demonstrate the approach on two test problems that the authors have used in previous work. The new algorithm does, however, have an increased computational complexity. We tackle this by presenting an algorithm that allows the non-convex, no fit polygon to be approximated. This means that much more of the search space can be considered and computational results show that better quality solutions can be achieved, in less time than when using the full no fit polygon algorithm.",
